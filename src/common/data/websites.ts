Website allows users to add, delete and edit their offers, providing a dynamic and user-friendly experience. With essential functionalities like user login, logout, theme change, category filters, and a search bar, the platform allows users to easily search and manage their offers.",
    experience:
      "While developing this application, I had the opportunity to expand my programming skills. I utilized technologies like React for front-end development and Node.js for the backend. PostgreSQL served as the database, not only storing data but also deepened my understanding of SQL. Netlify hosted the frontend, and hosting the backend application on Heroku improved my skills in server management. Storing images on Azure Storage Cloud deepened my knowledge of cloud-based solutions. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience in user authentication using PassportJS and JSON Web Token.  Furthermore, this project allowed me to explore Redux for efficient state management, eliminating the complexities of prop drilling. Overall, this project enabled me to showcase my skills and continually learn and apply new technologies to create a fully functional application. Market Place application was developed by me entirely from scratch.",
